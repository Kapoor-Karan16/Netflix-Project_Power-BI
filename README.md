# Netflix-Project_Power-BI

ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Data Analysis â€“ Power BI Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project comprehensively analyzes Netflixâ€™s content and user data to uncover key trends, content distribution, and platform insights using Power BI. The objective was to clean and model the data, build a relational database using MySQL, and visualize meaningful patterns through interactive dashboards in Power BI.

It simulates a real-world analytics task where a data analyst is expected to extract actionable insights for strategic decision-making in a streaming platform.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

Excel â€“ for initial data cleaning and structuring
MySQL â€“ for building a relational database and querying data
Power BI â€“ for data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations


ðŸ§© Project Workflow

Data Cleaning (Excel):

Removed null values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in title, date, and genre fields
Standardized column formats (e.g., release years, countries, durations)

Relational Database Setup (MySQL):

Imported the cleaned dataset into MySQL
Created multiple tables (e.g., Movies, TV Shows, Ratings, Categories)
Defined primary and foreign keys to establish table relationships
Wrote SQL queries to join, filter, and aggregate data for reporting

Data Modeling & Visualization (Power BI):

Imported structured tables from MySQL into Power BI
Established relationships using the Power BI data model
Created custom measures using DAX (e.g., content count, average duration, year-over-year trends)

Built interactive dashboards to explore:

Content type distribution (Movies vs. TV Shows)
Genre popularity over time
Content availability by country
Release trends by year
Ratings distribution and age classifications


ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Outcomes

Majority of content added after 2015, with a peak around 2019
Dramas and documentaries were the most common genres
The U.S., India, and the U.K. had the highest number of titles
TV Shows showed a growing trend year over year compared to Movies


ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

This project showcases end-to-end data analysis skills, from data cleaning and SQL-based modeling to advanced visualization in Power BI. It demonstrates the ability to transform raw entertainment data into compelling dashboards that help content teams and decision-makers understand viewer behavior and optimize content strategies.
